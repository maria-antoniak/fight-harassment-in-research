# Practical Actions to Fight Sexual Harassment in Academic Research


This is a document written by graduate students for everyone involved in academic research. The goal of this document is to identify practical actions that are **accessible now** to fight against sexual harassment in academic research.


## CONTEXTUAL NOTES

- This document should be understood as a series of “patches” rather than a single overarching solution to sexual harassment. There are immediate steps that we can take as a community to help people, even if the larger solutions are still unclear.
- This document is not about other gender-based struggles in tech and academia for equal pay, promotions, hiring, etc. 
- This document is not trying to convince anyone who doesn’t believe that sexual harassment is a problem. This document is targeted towards sympathetic allies. Likewise, none of our suggestions are aimed at perpetrators because we don’t know of any research that this would work (happy to be proven wrong, please let us know if you have evidence).
- This document is not focused on undergraduate students (e.g., it doesn’t discuss important aspects of the undergrad experiences like fraternities, dorms, and underage drinking).
- This document uses the term “victim” throughout, but different people might prefer “victim” or “survivor” depending on the recency of the experience, the framing of the discussion, and other factors. See here for a brief discussion of these terms.
- **Additions and edits are welcome and necessary!** Please feel free to make pull requests and/or contact us be email.



## RECOMMENDATIONS


### Inaction is action

- “Keeping the peace” or maintaining the status quo allows harassment and abuse to continue and increase. Silence, secrecy, and closed doors are harassment’s best friends. Taking this strategy, you might stop hearing about problems, but that’s likely because victims no longer trust you.
- Being an active ally can feel uncomfortable. There might not be one “correct” action to take, and it can be difficult to know how to best support victims. 
- Sexual harassment is not a new problem. There are many resources, research studies, and experts available. Educate yourself and others, and try not to lose hope or treat this problem as unsolvable.
- Harassers might be nice to you but drive other people out of the field. Be aware of your own biases, and don’t overweigh the harasser’s potential scientific contributions in contrast to their victims’ potential contributions.
- Beware the [“missing stair”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair) — ”a person within a social group who many people know is untrustworthy or otherwise has to be ‘managed’, but whom the group chooses to work around, by trying to quietly warn others of their behavior, rather than deal with them and their behavior openly.” The metaphor of the broken staircase emphasizes the absurdity of creating elaborate workarounds for the “missing stair” rather than directly “fixing the staircase.”


### Give more power to people who are currently lacking power

- Privilege can protect people. If there are ways to convey privilege to others, try to do that. Money and decision-making power are easy ways of shifting privilege.
- When people have stable financial support (salary, healthcare, not waiting on reimbursements, etc.), they also have more power to make their own decisions.
